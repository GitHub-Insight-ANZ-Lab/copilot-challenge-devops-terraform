# Terraform Challenge

Now you've had an opportunity to get started using GitHub Copilot, we have a number of challenges for you to attempt. Remember the goal here is not to test your technical knowledge but rather, see how you can use GitHub Copilot to help you complete these tasks.


## Challenge 1: Building Azure Infrastructure with Terraform and GitHub Copilot
Update `main.tf` to create the following resources:

**Goal:** Learn how to use Terraform, with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, to build a cloud infrastructure in Azure for hosting a full-stack React and .NET application, including a .NET Function App.

**Scenario:**
You are tasked with deploying a scalable cloud infrastructure on Azure for a full-stack web application that includes:

- Azure App Service (React Frontend) for hosting the React app.
- Azure App Service (Backend) for hosting the .NET backend API.
- Azure Function App for running serverless .NET functions.
- Azure Key Vault for storing secrets.
- Azure SQL Database for storing backend data.
- Azure Storage Account for static content, WebJobs, and logs.
- Azure Log Analytics and Application Insights for monitoring and logging.

You will write Terraform scripts to provision these resources, with the help of GitHub Copilot to guide you and provide code suggestions.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Provision Log Analytics and Application Insights

**Objective:** Configure Azure Log Analytics and Application Insights for monitoring and logging.

**Steps:**

1. Add resources for an Azure Log Analytics workspace.
2. Add an Application Insights resource for tracking App Services and the Function App.
3. Run `terrform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.
4. Run `terraform plan` to validate the configuration.

**Hint:** Type resource "azurerm_log_analytics_workspace" and resource "azurerm_application_insights" and use Copilot to help with setting up the resources.

#### Task 2: Create an Azure Storage Account

**Objective:** Provision a storage account for storing static content, WebJobs, and logs.

**Steps:**

1. Add a resource block to create an Azure Storage Account.
2. Run `terrform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.
3. Run `terraform plan` to validate the configuration.

**Hint:** Start typing resource "azurerm_storage_account" and let Copilot assist with completing the resource configuration.

#### Task 3: Provision Azure Key Vault

**Objective:** Create an Azure Key Vault to store secrets.

**Steps:**

1. Add a resource block to create an Azure Key Vault.
2. Configure the key vault to enable soft delete and purge protection.
3. Configure the key vault to enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
4. Run `terrform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.
5. Run `terraform plan` to validate the configuration.

**Hint:** 
    - Start typing resource "azurerm_key_vault with enable_rbac_authorization, purge protection and soft delete for 7 days" and let Copilot assist with completing the resource configuration.
    - Copilot might reference tenant_id from a non-existent variable. Use Copilot to help troubleshoot the error.

#### Task 4: Create an Azure SQL Database with Terraform Module

**Objective:** Set up a SQL Database for the .NET backend using a Terraform module to allow for reusable infrastructure.

**Steps:**

1. Create a Terraform module:
    - In a new folder (e.g., modules/sql_database), create a module that provisions both the Azure SQL Server and SQL Database resources. The folder structure should include:
        -  `main.tf` file for the module.
        -  `variables.tf` file for input variables.
        -  `outputs.tf` file for output variables.
    - The module should take in variables for key properties like the SQL Server name, resource group, sku name, admin username, admin password and etc.
    - The module should add the SQL Server Connection String to the Azure Key Vault.
2. Pass variables to the module:
    - In the root Terraform file, call the SQL Database module, passing in the required variables for the SQL Server and Database.
3. Output the connection string:
    - Output the SQL Server name, SQL Database name, and SQL Server FQDN and the connection string key vault secret name.
4. Run `terrform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.
5. Run `terraform plan` to validate the configuration.

**Hint:** 
    - Use Copilot to assist with creating the SQL Server and Database resource blocks inside the module.
    - You can start with the resource block "azurerm_sql_server" and "azurerm_sql_database", but the goal is to modularize these resources.


#### Task 5: Provision Azure App Services (React Frontend & .NET Backend)

**Objective:** Deploy two Azure App Services, one for the React app and another for the .NET backend API.

**Steps:**

1. Create a shared App Service Plan to host your apps and functions.

**Hint:** Start typing resource "azurerm_app_service_plan", and let Copilot assist in configuring the resource. 

2. 
    - Add resource blocks for both Azure App Services, linking them to the shared App Service Plan.
    - Configure app settings for both apps:
        - React frontend: Set the App Insights Instrumentation Key.
        - .NET backend: 
            - Set the SQL Database connection string by referencing the key vault secret name created in Task 4.
            - Set Application Insights Instrumentation Key.
3. Run `terrform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.
4. Run `terraform plan` to validate the configuration.
    
**Hint:** Start typing resource "azurerm_app_service to host a react app", and let Copilot assist in configuring both apps. Use Copilot to assist with configuring the app settings for both apps.

#### Task 6: Create and Configure Azure Function App (for .NET)

**Objective:** Deploy a .NET-based Azure Function App and configure it to use the Storage Account and Application Insights for monitoring.

**Steps:**

1. Add a resource block for an Azure Function App, linking it to the same App Service Plan.
2. Configure app settings for the Function App:
    - Set the Application Insights Instrumentation Key.
    - Set the SQL Database connection string.
    - Ensure the AzureWebJobsStorage is set to the connection to the Storage Account.
    - Ensure the function worker runtime and extension version are set.
3. Run `terrform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.
4. Run `terraform plan` to validate the configuration.

**Hint:** Start typing resource "azurerm_function_app", and Copilot will guide you through configuring it for a .NET function. Include settings for the instrumentation key AzureWebJobsStorage and all required settings to run the function app.

#### Task 7: Create variables for your environment

**Objective:** Create a variable file to store environment-specific values.

**Steps:**

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.
2. Create a terraform variable file (e.g., dev.tfvars)
3. Fill in the `dev.tfvars` file with the required variables.
    **Hint:** Ensure you have `variables.tf` file open in a separate tab. Copilot will assist with suggestions for the variables.
4. Run `terraform plan` to validate the configuration.
    **Hint:** Open the terminal, press `ctrl + I` or `cmd + I` to open Github Copilot chat and type `terraform plan using dev.tfvars variables`. GitHub Copilot will assist with the command.

#### Task 8: Run Terraform and Deploy Resources (Optional)

**Objective:** Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform.

**Steps:**

1. Initialize and apply Terraform to deploy all resources.
2. Verify that the resources are created successfully in the Azure Portal.

**Hint:** After typing terraform init and terraform apply, Copilot may assist with resolving errors. Add comments like # Run and deploy resources for additional help.


## Challenge 2: Document your terraform file

Try writing documentation for this Terraform script; GitHub Copilot will make suggestions for natural language documentation as well.

**Tip:** 
    - Use comments to document the Terraform script, and GitHub Copilot will help you write more detailed documentation.
    - Use the `#` symbol to start a comment and describe the purpose of each resource block, variable, or module.
    - Use @workspaces to write documentation for the whole repo.


## Challenge 3: Verify your Terraform file using Trivy

- Trivy is a comprehensive open-source security scanner for cloud infrastructure, including Terraform. Use Trivy to verify the Terraform file you’ve just completed to detect any security issues.

:bulb: Trivy is preinstalled in the Codespaces environment. If you are not using the Codespaces environment, you will need to visit https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.56/getting-started/installation/ to install the tool locally.

- In VSCode, in the terminal panel, enter trivy config to run the tool against the Terraform file. Depending on the changes you’ve made, there may be several issues identified. It’s crucial to understand that GitHub Copilot’s output (or any generated output) should always be reviewed and verified. Ensure that your existing processes are followed to review and approve any changes before merging into your main branch.

### How to use Trivy

1. Create a terraform plan and save it to a file:
`terraform plan --out tfplan.binary`
2. Next, convert the file into json format:
`terraform show -json tfplan.binary > tfplan.json`
3. Run Trivy against the json file:
`trivy config ./tfplan.json`
