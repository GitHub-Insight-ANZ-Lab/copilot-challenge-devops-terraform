# Terraform Challenge

Now you've had an opportunity to get started using GitHub Copilot, we have a number of challenges for you to attempt. Remember the goal here is not to test your technical knowledge but rather, see how you can use GitHub Copilot to help you complete these tasks.


## Challenge 1: Building Azure Infrastructure with Terraform and GitHub Copilot
Update `main.tf` to create the following resources:

**Goal:** Learn how to use Terraform, with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, to build a cloud infrastructure in Azure for hosting a full-stack React and .NET application, including a .NET Function App.

**Scenario:**
You are tasked with deploying a scalable cloud infrastructure on Azure for a full-stack web application that includes:

- Azure App Service (React Frontend) for hosting the React app.
- Azure App Service (Backend) for hosting the .NET backend API.
- Azure Function App for running serverless .NET functions.
- Azure SQL Database for storing backend data.
- Azure Storage Account for static content, WebJobs, and logs.
- Azure Log Analytics and Application Insights for monitoring and logging.

You will write Terraform scripts to provision these resources, with the help of GitHub Copilot to guide you and provide code suggestions.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Provision Log Analytics and Application Insights

**Objective:** Configure Azure Log Analytics and Application Insights for monitoring and logging.

**Steps:**

1. Add resources for an Azure Log Analytics workspace.
2. Add an Application Insights resource for tracking App Services and the Function App.

**Hint:** Type resource "azurerm_log_analytics_workspace" and resource "azurerm_application_insights" and use Copilot to help with setting up the resources.

#### Task 2: Create an Azure Storage Account

**Objective:** Provision a storage account for storing static content, WebJobs, and logs.

**Steps:**

1. Add a resource block to create an Azure Storage Account.

**Hint:** Start typing resource "azurerm_storage_account" and let Copilot assist with completing the resource configuration.


#### Task 3: Provision Azure App Services (React Frontend & .NET Backend)

**Objective:** Deploy two Azure App Services, one for the React app and another for the .NET backend API.

**Steps:**

1. Create a shared App Service Plan to host your apps and functions.

**Hint:** Start typing resource "azurerm_app_service_plan", and let Copilot assist in configuring the resource. 

2. 
    - Add resource blocks for both Azure App Services, linking them to the shared App Service Plan.
    - Configure app settings for both apps:
        - React frontend: Set the App Insights Instrumentation Key.
        - .NET backend: 
            - Set the SQL Database connection string.
            - Set Application Insights Instrumentation Key.
    
**Hint:** Start typing resource "azurerm_app_service to host a react app", and let Copilot assist in configuring both apps. Use Copilot to assist with configuring the app settings for both apps.

#### Task 4: Create and Configure Azure Function App (for .NET)

**Objective:** Deploy a .NET-based Azure Function App and configure it to use the Storage Account and Application Insights for monitoring.

**Steps:**

1. Add a resource block for an Azure Function App, linking it to the same App Service Plan.
2. Configure app settings for the Function App:
    - Set the Application Insights Instrumentation Key.
    - Set the SQL Database connection string.
    - Ensure the AzureWebJobsStorage is set to the connection to the Storage Account.
    - Ensure the function worker runtime and extension version are set.

**Hint:** Start typing resource "azurerm_function_app", and Copilot will guide you through configuring it for a .NET function. Include settings for the instrumentation key AzureWebJobsStorage and all required settings to run the function app.

#### Task 5: Create an Azure SQL Database

**Objective:** Set up a SQL Database for the .NET backend to use.

**Steps:**

1. Add a resource block for an Azure SQL Server.
2. Define a SQL Database with a basic pricing tier.

**Hint:** Use Copilot to assist with the SQL server configuration, starting with resource "azurerm_sql_server".

#### Task 6: Run Terraform and Deploy Resources (Optional)

**Objective:** Deploy the infrastructure using Terraform.

**Steps:**

1. Initialize and apply Terraform to deploy all resources.
2. Verify that the resources are created successfully in the Azure Portal.

**Hint:** After typing terraform init and terraform apply, Copilot may assist with resolving errors. Add comments like # Run and deploy resources for additional help.


## Challenge 2: Document your terraform file

Try writing documentation for this Terraform script; GitHub Copilot will make suggestions for natural language documentation as well.


## Challenge 3: Verify your Terraform file using tfsec

- `tfsec` is an open source static analysis security scanner for your Terraform code. Use `tfsec` to verify that the terraform file you've just completed to detect any issues.
>:bulb: tfsec is preinstalled in the Codespaces environment. If you are not using the Codespaces environment, you will need to visit https://aquasecurity.github.io/tfsec/v1.28.1/ to install the tool locally.
- In VSCode, in the **terminal** panel, enter `tfsec` to run the tool against the terraform file. Depending on any changes you've made, there will likely be a number of issues identified. It's important to realise that GitHub Copilot's output (or any generated output for that matter) should always be reviewed and verified. Your existing processes should be followed to ensure that any changes are reviewed and approved before being merged into your main branch.


### What's next?

Let's move to the next exercise [github actions challenge](<./4. github actions challenge.md>) to see how you can leverage the power of GitHub Copilot to solve a number of challenges yourself.
