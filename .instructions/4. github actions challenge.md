## Challenge 1: Migrate Jenkins Pipeline to GitHub Actions

### Objective

The goal of this exercise is to use GitHub Copilot to help you write a GitHub Actions workflow that mirrors a Jenkins pipeline. You will be provided with a sample Jenkinsfile that defines a simple pipeline for building and verifying Terraform code. Your task is to use GitHub Copilot to assist you in writing the equivalent GitHub Actions workflow.

The following is a sample Jenkinsfile for a simple pipeline that builds and verifies terraform code
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        // Define Terraform version to use (if Terraform is installed via tfenv)
        TF_VERSION = '1.5.0'
        // Directory where your Terraform files are located
        TERRAFORM_DIR = 'terraform'
        // Azure environment variables (use Jenkins credentials for secure authentication)
        ARM_CLIENT_ID = credentials('azure-client-id')
        ARM_CLIENT_SECRET = credentials('azure-client-secret')
        ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = credentials('azure-subscription-id')
        ARM_TENANT_ID = credentials('azure-tenant-id')
    }

    stages {
        stage('Initialize') {
            steps {
                echo "Initializing Terraform..."
                dir(TERRAFORM_DIR) {
                    sh 'terraform init'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Validate Terraform') {
            steps {
                echo "Validating Terraform files..."
                dir(TERRAFORM_DIR) {
                    sh 'terraform validate'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Run Terraform Plan') {
            steps {
                echo "Running Terraform Plan..."
                dir(TERRAFORM_DIR) {
                    sh 'terraform plan --out tfplan.binary'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Run Trivy Checks') {
            steps {
                echo "Running trivy checks..."
                dir(TERRAFORM_DIR) {
                    sh 'terraform show -json tfplan.binary > tfplan.json'
                    sh 'trivy config ./tfplan.json'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Terraform Apply') {
            steps {
                script {
                    input message: 'Do you want to proceed with Terraform apply?'
                }
                echo "Applying Terraform changes to Azure..."
                dir(TERRAFORM_DIR) {
                    // Since ARM_CLIENT_ID, ARM_CLIENT_SECRET, etc., are available as environment variables,
                    // Terraform will automatically authenticate with Azure.
                    sh 'terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Archive Terraform Plan') {
            steps {
                echo "Archiving the Terraform Plan output..."
                dir(TERRAFORM_DIR) {
                    archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'tfplan', allowEmptyArchive: true
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            echo "Cleaning up..."
            dir(TERRAFORM_DIR) {
                deleteDir()
            }
        }
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline completed successfully.'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed. Please check the logs.'
        }
    }
}
```

### Task

Your task is to use GitHub Copilot to help you write a GitHub Actions workflow that mirrors the Jenkins pipeline defined above. The GitHub Actions workflow should be triggered on every pull request and push to the main branch. It should include the following jobs:

1. Initialize Terraform using `terraform init`.
2. Validate Terraform files using `terraform validate`.
3. Run Terraform Plan using `terraform plan`.
4. Run terraform checks using `trivy`.
5. Apply Terraform changes using `terraform apply`.
6. Archive the Terraform Plan output.

You can use the provided Jenkinsfile as a reference to help you write the GitHub Actions workflow. GitHub Copilot will assist you in generating the necessary YAML configuration and commands for the workflow.

### Success Criteria

- The GitHub Actions workflow should run successfully and output a Terraform plan.
- The workflow should be structured and run without errors.
- Use of GitHub Copilot to streamline the development process.

## Challenge 2: Build, Test and Package .NET application using GitHub Actions

### Objective

The goal of this exercise is to refactor the previously created GitHub Actions workflow to include additional steps for building, testing and dockerizing a sample .NET Core application. You will use GitHub Copilot to help you write the necessary Dockerfile and YAML configuration and commands for the workflow.

### Task:

You have a sample .NET Core application `./sample_dotnet_app` that you want to build, test and dockerize using GitHub Actions. Your task is to refactor the existing GitHub Actions workflow to include the following steps:

1. Create a Dockerfile to package the application.
2. Build the .NET Core application using `dotnet build`.
3. Run unit tests using `dotnet test`.
4. Publish the application using `dotnet publish`.
5. Build a Docker image using the Dockerfile.

You can use the provided sample .NET Core application as a reference to help you write the GitHub Actions workflow. GitHub Copilot will assist you in generating the necessary Dockerfile and YAML configuration and commands for the workflow.

### Success Criteria

- The GitHub Actions workflow should run successfully.
- The workflow should be structured and run without errors.
- Use of GitHub Copilot to streamline the development process.
