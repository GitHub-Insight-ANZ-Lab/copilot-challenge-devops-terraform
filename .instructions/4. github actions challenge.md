## Challenge 1: Migrate Jenkins Pipeline to GitHub Actions

### Objective

The goal of this exercise is to use GitHub Copilot to help you write a GitHub Actions workflow that mirrors a Jenkins pipeline. You will be provided with a sample Jenkinsfile that defines a simple pipeline for building and verifying Terraform code. Your task is to use GitHub Copilot to assist you in writing the equivalent GitHub Actions workflow.

[jenkins_pipeline](./sample_pipeline/jenkins_pipeline.groovy) is a sample Jenkinsfile for a simple pipeline that builds and verifies terraform code.

### Task

Your task is to use GitHub Copilot to help you write a GitHub Actions workflow that mirrors the Jenkins pipeline referenced above. The GitHub Actions workflow should be triggered on every pull request and push to the main branch. It should include the following jobs:

**Prep:** Set up the GitHub Actions workflow file

- Create a new file in your repository named `.github/workflows/terraform-pipeline.yml`
- Begin typing name: and use GitHub Copilot to generate the boilerplate for the workflow name and triggers.
- Open `./sample_pipeline/jenkins_pipeline.groovy` file in a separate tab to add to Copilot's context.

**Tip:** Start typing on: and let Copilot suggest pull request and push triggers.

**Step 1:** Define Provision Infrastructure Job

- Create a job called `provision_infra` that runs on ubuntu-latest using Copilot. Start typing “jobs:” and Copilot will help you define the job structure.

**Step 2:** Define Terraform Initialization Job

- Add Terraform initialization step `terraform init` with Copilot’s assistance.

**Tip:** Copilot will suggest the steps: and the working directory where your Terraform files are located.

**Step 3:** Validate Terraform Files

- Define the next step for validating Terraform. Type `terraform validate` and let Copilot autocomplete the command for validating the Terraform files.

**Tip:** Copilot will offer syntax for the terraform validate command, ensuring it runs within the correct directory.

**Step 4:** Run Terraform Plan

-  Add a step to run the Terraform plan. Begin typing `terraform plan` and Copilot will suggest the correct syntax, including specifying the output plan file (tfplan.binary).

**Tip:** Ensure Copilot suggests a valid directory path and flags for outputting the plan to a file.

**Step 5:** Run Trivy Checks

- Add a step for running Trivy checks. Copilot can help install Trivy and suggest the correct command `trivy config --severity HIGH,CRITICAL .`.

**Tip:** Start typing `install trivy` and Copilot will offer a command for installing Trivy in your environment.

**Step 6:** Apply Terraform Changes

- Add a step for applying Terraform changes. Begin typing `terraform apply` and Copilot will complete the step, including the necessary flags like -auto-approve and the input file (tfplan.binary).

**Tip:** Copilot can also help you add a step to prompt user confirmation before applying the changes.

**Step 7:** Archive Terraform Plan Output

- Add a step for archiving the Terraform plan. Start typing archiveArtifacts: and let Copilot suggest the correct path and file (e.g., tfplan.binary).

**Tip:** Copilot will help you complete the YAML for archiving the output file, ensuring the correct syntax.

You can use the provided Jenkinsfile as a reference to help you write the GitHub Actions workflow. GitHub Copilot will assist you in generating the necessary YAML configuration and commands for the workflow.

### Success Criteria

- The GitHub Actions workflow should run successfully and output a Terraform plan.
- The workflow should be structured and run without errors.
- Use of GitHub Copilot to streamline the development process.

## Challenge 2: Build, Test and Package .NET application using GitHub Actions

### Objective

The goal of this exercise is to refactor the previously created GitHub Actions workflow to include additional steps for building, testing and dockerizing a sample .NET Core application. You will use GitHub Copilot to help you write the necessary Dockerfile and YAML configuration and commands for the workflow.

### Task:

You have a sample .NET Core application `./sample_dotnet_app` that you want to build, test and dockerize using GitHub Actions. Your task is to refactor the existing GitHub Actions workflow to include the following steps:

**Step 1:** Create a Dockerfile to package the application

- Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your `./sample_dotnet_app` and name the file `Dockerfile`.
- Start by typing FROM in a new Dockerfile. GitHub Copilot will suggest the appropriate .NET Core SDK base image.

**Tip:** Use Copilot's suggestions to add commands like COPY, WORKDIR, and RUN to copy the application files and restore dependencies.

**Step 2:** Add Build and Test App Job

- Modify your GitHub Actions workflow created in the previous challenge to include a job called `build_app` for building and testing the .NET Core application.

**Tip:** In the workflow file move the cursor to the same level as the provision_infra job and type `build_app` and Copilot will suggest a few steps to build and test the .NET Core application.

**Step 3:** Checkout code

- Add a step to check out the code from the repository using the `actions/checkout@v2` action.

**Tip:** Under steps, start typing `- name: Checkout code` in the workflow YAML file, and Copilot will suggest the correct syntax for checking out the code.

**Step 4:** Install .NET Core SDK

- Add a step to install the .NET Core SDK.
- Start typing `- name: Install .NET Core SDK` in the workflow YAML file, and Copilot will suggest the correct syntax for installing the SDK.

**Tip:** Copilot will offer the correct syntax for installing the .NET Core SDK, ensuring the correct version is used.

**Step 5:** Build the .NET Core Application

- Add a step that builds the application using `dotnet build` command.

**Tip:** 
    - Begin by typing `- name: Build App`, and let Copilot generate the necessary actions to install .NET Core, check out the code, and run dotnet build.
    - Add the following property to the step: `working-directory: ${{ github.workspace }}/sample_dotnet_app`.

**Step 6:** Run Unit Tests

- Add a step in the workflow to run unit tests using `dotnet test` command.

**Tip:** 
    - Type `- name: Run tests` in your workflow YAML file, and Copilot will offer the complete step for running dotnet test with useful flags like --no-build.
    - Add the following property to the step: `working-directory: ${{ github.workspace }}/sample_dotnet_app/TodoApi.Test`.

**Step 7:** Publish the Application

- Add a step for publishing the application using `dotnet publish` command.
- Start typing dotnet publish, and Copilot will suggest the command along with options for specifying the output directory.

**Tip:** 
- Type `- name: Publish App` in your workflow YAML file and Copilot will suggest the complete step for publishing the application.
- Copilot will autocomplete options such as `-c Release -o ./publish`, ensuring your published files are properly placed for later packaging into a Docker image.
- Start typing `working-directory:` in a new line and Copilot will suggest the correct path to the application directory.

**Step 8:** Build a Docker Image

- Add a step to build a Docker image using the Dockerfile you created.
- When you type docker build, GitHub Copilot will suggest the complete command, including the context and tagging of the image.

**Tip:** As you start typing: `- name: Build Docker image`, Copilot will generate the complete Docker build command `docker build -t my-app:latest .` and any necessary options.

You can use the provided sample .NET Core application as a reference to help you write the GitHub Actions workflow. GitHub Copilot will assist you in generating the necessary Dockerfile and YAML configuration and commands for the workflow.

### Success Criteria

- The GitHub Actions workflow should run successfully.
- The workflow should be structured and run without errors.
- Use of GitHub Copilot to streamline the development process.
